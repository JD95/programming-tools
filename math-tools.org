** basic math functions
 | function | meaning        |
 |----------+----------------|
 | +        | addition       |
 | -        | subtraction    |
 | =*=      | multiplication |
 | =/=      | division       |
 | %        | modulus        |

 #+REVEAL: split
 - note that the word "operator" might show up in the place of function at some point.
 - an operator is just a function with a funny symbol instead of a word for a name.
   
** char math
 - remember that characters are represented as numbers in an ascii table
 - every value of =char= is a number that corresponds to a symbol
 - because =char= values are secretly numbers, you can actually do math with them
 #+BEGIN_SRC cpp
 // This converts a character letter (between 'A-Z') to its lower case
 // version by adding the difference between 'a' and 'A' since the number
 // for 'a' is greater than for 'A'
 char lower_case(char c) {
   return c + ('a' - 'A');
 }
 #+END_SRC
 
** string math
 - strings can be combined using =+=
 #+BEGIN_SRC cpp
 // combine("pop", "tart") would return "poptart"
 string combine(string first, string second) {
   return first + second;
 }
 #+END_SRC
